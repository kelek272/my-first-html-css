The language in Hyper Light Drifter that was used by the original race (some call them "Librarians") on their monoliths. It's odd in several ways when compared to ours: it has only 13 different letters and contains no equivelant for J Q X or Z so I've only included them in the font as a placeholder symbol when typing in uppercase and assigned them to a free glyph in lowercase. Every other letter also shares a glyph, meaning each can mean 2 different things depending on context.

The only punctuation in the language is a comma and ampersand but I've added a full stop and numbers for convenience purposes.
