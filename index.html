					Take a moment.

				<p class="shadow">
					Think of one of your favorite stories. Let the events replay in your mind as you recall them. Which elements are the primary reasons for your love of it? Would you consider these elements essential to great storytelling?
				</p>
				<p class="shadow">
					Now imagine experiencing another story for the first time, but without those very elements. Could you even consider liking it?
				</p>
				<p class="shadow">
					The story I have chosen begins with a world once in harmony, its diverse and brilliant peoples working together to ensure lasting quality of life. A story of power and those who studied it, worshipped it, lusted for it, harnessed it, abused it, and were consumed by it.
				</p>
				<p class="shadow">
					This prologue, as well as the unwritten adventure that followed, comprise a story without words. Additionally, though typically in abundance in notable story-driven video games, cinematic cutscenes are rarely used and never longer than a few seconds.
				</p>
				<p class="shadow">
					A team of seven with already few means of building this tragic yet beautifully immersive world decided still to forego use of text. Despite this (or even because of this), the visual design, evolving music, and stripped-down controls excel at directing the player's focus to the story being told all around them.
